        <h2><strong>The more the merrier</strong></h2> 
            <p>It's hard to lock this recipe down to any few particular ingredients, because <em>any number of vegetables</em> can take a stir-fry to a completely different place. The ingredients listed below are what I would choose if I had my ideal pick, but stir-fry is a meal that allows you to throw any random leftovers in a pan and get some extra mileage out of it</p>
            <p>There are many ways to serve stir-fry, whether it's over plain white rice, or you throw the rice in the pan. You may even add some noodles to the equation and make something really special. There is no right way, just enjoy it however you'd like.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cubed or shredded chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 Sliced green bell pepper and an equal volume of szechaun chilis sliced longways</li>
                <li>1 Thinly sliced white onion</li>
                <li>1 Head of broccoli trimmed into florrettes</li>
                <li>3-4 Diced cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>Any variety of vegetable oil</li>
                <li>(optional) 1 tbsp sesame oil and sesame seeds</li>
                <h3>Sauces</h3>
                <p>I add sauces to taste. Judging amounts by the color, aroma, and taste is the best way to avoid adding too much or too little of something. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Light soy</li>
                    <li>Terriyaki</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Chilli oil</li>
                    <li>(Optional) Oyster sauce</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>The entire premise of stir-fry is to continuously stir and move the ingredients once they're in the pan. <strong>A large pan</strong> is key to success, and so is <strong>preparation</strong>. Get all of your ingredients chopped, set out, and ready to be tossed in the pan. Once this starts it's gonna be a <strong><em>fast</em></strong> process.</p>
            <p>One important note is that when frying in this way you <strong>dont</strong> want to turn the heat down, <em>especially</em> if you have an old electric stove. Keep your burner blazing hot and remove the pan to lower the temperature as needed. This will give you more moment to moment control. This tip may not necessarily apply in a restauraunt where they have professional grade burners that are incredibly strong, but most of our home gas and electric stovetops are not quite as versatile.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Get pan incredibly hot</li>
                <li>Add 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil, then add onions, garlic, green peppers, and chilis, then salt everything (Sesame/Chilli oil optionally added over vegetables now)</li> 
                <li>If your chicken is raw add it once the vegetables begin to sweat, otherwise add chicken <strong>just</strong> before adding your sauces later on</li>
                <li>Continue stirring until chicken pieces are white around the outside, then add your sauces and broccoli</li>
                <li>Place lid over pan and let broccoli steam lightly for a minute or two</li>
                <li>Remove lid, stir, and give a taste. It may need salt or pepper, otherwise place pan on low heat until ready to serve </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you'd like to add sesame seeds, place them on top at the end. Toasting the seeds dry in a pan will power them up.</p>
