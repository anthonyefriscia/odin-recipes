        <h2><strong>"I don't know what to make for a large group of guests"</strong></h2> 
            <p>Congratulations, I have solved your problem. This meal consists of <strong>inexpensive</strong> ingredients and <em>minimal</em> prep work. While you're going to have to set up an area to fry in, this makes katsu a perfect meal to make for a large group. If you're going to make your entire kitchen greasy mess, you might as well get the most out of it while you're there.</p>
            <p>In gerneral, Katsu will come in two forms. Chicken (torikatsu) and pork (tonkatsu). Both are equally great choices, but since I have a chicken based stir-fry elsewhere on this website, I will be running with pork for this recipe. The process is the same regardless.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>This recipe has a deceptively short list of ingredients. You can add a <em>ton</em> of different kinds of flavors and spices to this, but I'm going to give you a basic recipe I prefer to use as a starting point.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enough oil to submerge your cutlets in your pot of choice(aim for high walls if possible)</li>
                <li>At least 2 cups of panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>2 to 3 eggs</li>
                <li>1-1.5 cups of flower</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper, and garlic powder
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Katsu can be very easy and effecient, but it can also be overwhelming and disastrous. Make sure you use wide bowls with high tops wherever you can in the following steps. Also, when breading keep one hand for dry and the other wet. This will make sense after you set up bowls.</p>
            <h3>Station Setup</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice your cutlets however you like. If your cutlets are more than an inch thick, you will want to consider lowering the temperature on your oil a bit so the middle has time to cook before the outside gets too dark</li>
                    <li>Set 3 bowls next to eachother. The biggest bowl should be used for the panko. in another bowl put your flower, and in the last bowl beat your eggs (I add about a tbsp of water but this might not matter)</li>
                    <li>Season the breadcrumbs and the flower however you wish. err on the side of overseasoning.</li>
                    <p><strong>You are now set up.</strong> Wash your hands one last time and get ready to bread some cutlets.</p>
                </ol>
            <h3>Breading</h3>
            <p>I recommend laying out a tray with parchment paper to place your cutlets on after they are breaded. You can fry as you bread if you want, but as a beginner this can become a complete nightmare very quickly.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use dry hand to place cutlet into flour bowl; coat piece completely</li>
                    <li>Use dry hand to place cutlet gently into egg wash, then use your wet hand to coat the piece</li>
                    <li>Use wet hand to place cutlet into panko bowl, then press down firmly with your dry hand</li>
                    <li>Flip the cutlet, cover it in panko, and press firmly again</li>
                    <li>Repeat until piece is completely covered and panko sticks to cutlet</li>
                    <li>Repeat until all cutlets are covered and place tray in fridge until they are ready to be fried</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Frying</h3>
                   <p>You have officially made it through the hard part. If you're currently wondering how this is supposed to be a headache free meal then you defintely did it right. Trust me though, homemade fried cutlets done this way will always be worth it. Let's finish the process.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get the tallest pot you have and <strong>DO NOT</strong> fill it any higer than 1/3 of the way up with oil. It is ideal that your cutlets can float freely but in a small home kitchen hot oil should be respected and closely monitored.</li>
                    <li>Allow your oil to reach about 325 degrees Fahrenheit (If you don't have a way to measure this, consider this. the oil should sizzle nicely when the cutlet is lowered in, but if the oil explosively spews steam and crackles out of control, that's definitely too hot)</li>
                    <li>Thin cutlets will only take about a minute and a half on each side, but monitor them closesly and dont be afraid to take it out and check the internal tempterature. <strong>chicken and pork should be about 165 degrees Fahrenheit after resting</strong>. Pork can technically be cooked to a lower temperature safely, do so at your own risk and make sure to do your research.</li>
                    <li>Place finished cutlets on <strong>wire rack</strong> ideally, or a plate with paper towels to soak up the innevitable oil drip.</li>
                </ol>       
                <p>Great job, you're done. Allow the meat to rest 3 to 5 minutes before serving. Katsu is delicious when served with rice, or on sadwiches pired with cabbage and even my favorite <a href="../recipes/chipotle.html">chipotle dip</a>.</p>
