        <h2><strong>Don't let the restauraunts fool you</strong></h2> 
            <p>This 3 ingredient chipotle base seems to grow in popularity every day, and I'm here to show you the formula I learned from my time working food service. This is by far the <strong>simplest recipe</strong> on this site. I think it's important to learn easy combinations by taste because it trains you to trust yourself in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>Most people use this dip on fried foods or anything with a good snap to it, but by adding more ingredients or substituting the chipotle for other peppers, you can eyeball a simple sauce that frees your mind up so you can focus on other parts of a given meal. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Substitutions are recomended and even <em>encouraged</em> in this recipe. If you prefer low fat mayo like myself that is an easy switch. Sriracha paste in place of chipotle peppers is another good example of a delicious alternative.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 Cup of your choice of mayonaise</li>
                <li>1 Can of whole chipotle peppers(paste works, <strong>whole canned peppers</strong> reccomended)</li>
                <li>~1 tsp Garlic powder (+black pepper optionally)</li>
           </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div class="ingr">
                <ol>
                    <li>(If you bought whole chipotles) Blend, process, mash, or dice your chipotles to your preferrered consistency (smaller chunks=smoother sauce)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Place 1 cup of mayo into a bowl or sealable container</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Measure out about 1 tablespoon of your chipotle paste and add it to your mayo</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Sprinkle in about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Fold your sauce together being careful to scrape the sides of the bowl down</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        <p>At this point I reccomended you <em><strong>taste</strong></em> the sauce, and adjust the ingredients to taste. Peppers can vary in flavor even among the same batch, so let your intuition guide you. If it tastes a little bland, maybe even bitter, add some garlic powder and fold it in. This is an incredibly easy recipe to practice taste testing on.</p>
        <p>The reason I reccomend canned chipotles is that you'll have plenty leftover, and they keep a long time in the fridge. If you mess up you can add more of any of the main ingredients to level it back out. <strong>Start small and enjoy!</strong></p>
