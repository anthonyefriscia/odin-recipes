        <h2>Why Bother Cooking?</h2>
            <p>Cooking, much like painting, writing, or programming, is a creative endeavor that allows people to find joy
                 in their struggle. By challenging yourself to cook new foods, you will not only eat better on a day to 
                 day basis, but will surely eel satisfied with your progress and tangible outcomes.</p>
            <p>Do not think of cooking as a chore, think of it as <em>an opportunity to outdo any overpriced takeout</em> you
                would have bought otherwise. In the following section I will link <strong>3 easy recipes</strong> that will leave not only youreslf. but any future guests impressed.</p>
