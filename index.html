        <h2>Why Bother Cooking?</h2>
            <p>Cooking, much like painting, writing, or programming, is a creative endeavor that allows people to find joy
                 in their struggle. By challenging yourself to cook new foods, you will not only eat better on a day to 
                 day basis, but will surely feel satisfied with your progress and the tangible outcomes.</p>
            <p>Do not think of cooking as a chore, think of it as <em>an opportunity to outdo any overpriced takeout</em> you
                would have bought otherwise. In the following section I will link <strong>3 easy recipes</strong> that will leave not only youreslf. but any future guests impressed.</p>

        <h2>Train Your intuition</h2>
                <p>So much of cooking comes down to your personal preference and trust in yourself to make decisions that deviate from a recipe. Something that was reinforced to me through my time in food service was the power of tasting. You may not have a great understanding of cooking with intuition right now, but if youa ctively taste your food at the different stages of cooking, you will learn nuance betwen ingredients that you may have never even considered in the past.</p>
